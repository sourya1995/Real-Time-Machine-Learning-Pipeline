# üí° Real-Time Machine Learning System with LLM Agents

This repository contains the design, architecture, and implementation plan for a production-grade **Real-Time Machine Learning (RTML)** system. It combines **stream-first data processing**, **dynamic ML model routing**, and **LLM-powered agents** with a fully integrated observability, compliance, and frontend layer ‚Äî suitable for low-latency, multi-tenant environments.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The system is built to process **high-velocity data** in real time, make **intelligent predictions**, and support **smart agents** that interact with search and graph backends. It supports complete lifecycle management ‚Äî from ingestion to prediction, feedback, retraining, and explainability ‚Äî and is ready for enterprise deployment with **multi-region HA**, **GDPR compliance**, and **zero-trust security**.

---

## üß± Architecture Components

### üîπ Stream-First Core

* Uses **RisingWave** to process data streams in real time (Kafka + SQL-like queries).
* Supports windowed aggregations, feature generation, and anomaly detection.
* Unified with **Apache Iceberg** for ACID-compliant time-travel storage and analytics.

### üîπ Data Ingestion

* Multi-format ingestion APIs (raw binary & structured JSON) with rate-limiting and validation.
* Custom **DataRouter** handles streaming vs batch routing per data type.

### üîπ Machine Learning Pipeline

* **Dynamic Model Router** supports multiple active models (RNN, CNN, hybrid).
* Models selected and combined per-tenant using **weighted ensemble logic**.
* Feedback loop integrated for online accuracy tracking and model re-ranking.
* Feature store and model registry implemented using Iceberg tables.

### üîπ LLM Agent Integrations

Agents enhance raw predictions with contextual reasoning:

* üîç **Search Agent** ‚Äî integrates with **ElasticSearch** for semantic enrichment (e.g., historical logs, similar incidents).
* üï∏Ô∏è **Graph Agent** ‚Äî queries **Neo4J** to map root-cause chains or entity dependencies.
* üß† **Reasoning Agent** ‚Äî uses prompt chaining to summarize anomalies and trigger alerts (via **Prometheus**, **Opsgenie**, etc.).

> All agents are orchestrated to run in parallel and enrich the prediction pipeline output in real time.

### üîπ GraphQL API

* Full-featured schema with support for:

  * Real-time and historical analytics
  * Prediction feedback
  * Model metadata queries
  * Feature lineage and audit logs

### üîπ Next.js Dashboard

* Built with **Next.js + Apollo Client**.
* Real-time charts for metrics, predictions, anomalies.
* Feedback workflow for model outputs.
* Uses subscriptions and stale-while-revalidate caching for performance.

---

## üîê Security & Compliance

* **Zero-Trust Security Architecture**: mTLS, JWT, service mesh, encrypted storage.
* **GDPR Ready**: Supports tokenization, PII detection, right-to-erasure, and audit trails.
* **Secrets Management**: Integrated with **HashiCorp Vault**.
* **Audit Logs**: All access, predictions, and erasure events are logged and queryable.

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Infrastructure & Deployment

* Designed for **Kubernetes**, deployed across **multi-region clusters**.
* Uses **Iceberg snapshot replication** and **RisingWave failover** to meet **RTO/RPO** targets.
* Chaos engineering plan included for failure simulation.

---

## üìä Observability

* **Metrics**: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards (ML latency, drift, ingestion rate).
* **Logs**: ELK or OpenSearch stack.
* **Traces**: OpenTelemetry-based tracing for prediction latency and agent activity.
* **Alerts**: Alertmanager rules for high latency, model drift, backlog growth, etc.

---

## üß™ DR & Chaos Engineering

* Automated failover workflows for control planes and data layers.
* Periodic simulation of outages: stream processor failure, region outage, storage corruption.
* Custom recovery automation for snapshot promotion and routing update.
